Welcome to the refreshed site! This first post is a placeholder so you can see how the Cayman theme renders blog entries.

When you're ready to publish something real, duplicate this file, change the filename to `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`, and update the front matter above. Jekyll will automatically add the entry to the blog index and the feed.
